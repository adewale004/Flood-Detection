# Flood-Detection
In mid-2022, a devastating flood impacted a large part of the Sindh province in Pakistan following heavy monsoon rains. This event led to the deaths of over 1,000 people, with more than 10 million individuals being displaced. Sentinel-2, a satellite developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), captured images in January and September 2022 that clearly illustrate the before and after effects of the flooding in Sindh. The attached false-color composite images, using shortwave infrared, near infrared, and green bands, highlight the dramatic changes. They show a substantial expanse of once green land transformed into blue-flooded regions. Detection of the flooded areas was achieved using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Modified NDWI (MNDWI), which classified water and non-water pixels in both images before and after the flood. The images reveal that the flood impacted an area of over 7,733 sq. km of land. The flood detection image demonstrates the power of remote sensing in understanding environmental threats and mitigating damage. Through sophisticated processing, raw earth observation data becomes actionable intelligence. Whether dealing with flooding, fires, or deforestation, these “eyes in the sky” contribute to safeguarding our planet.
